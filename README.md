## What is Void?
Void New Tab is an open-source minimalist new tab extensions for web browsers. I created void because I couldn't find any minimalist new tab pages that satisfied me.

## How to use?
You can install void by downloading this git repository and setting your new tab page to the index.html file. There will soon be a Chrome, Firefox and Opera package on eaches respective app stores that will enable you to recieve automatic updates.
