# void-newtab

## What is Void?
Void New Tab is an open-source minimalist new tab extensions for web browsers. I created void because I couldn't find any minimalist new tab pages that satisfied me.

New Tab Page:

## How to install?
You can install void by downloading this git repository and setting your new tab page to the index.html file. There will soon be a Chrome, Firefox and Opera package on eaches respective app stores that will enable you to recieve automatic updates.

## How to use?
I designed Void to be as user friendly as possible. You can bring up a help screen with all the different commands on it by typing "help" into the search bar. You can also bring up an about page with all the relevant infomation about the project by typing in "about".
